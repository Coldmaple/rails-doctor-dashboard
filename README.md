# Dashboard Overview
This is a simple exercise to assess your ability to use Rails to build web applications. The goal is to see how well you understand various concepts related to web app development, as well as your ability to pick up and learn new concepts. This exercise should not take you more than 8-12 hours. If it does, please let me know so I can reduce the scope of what is asked. 

The goal is not to:
- Produce a fully working application
- Get everything pixel-perfect
